# --- Frontend ---

frontend: ## Install frontend dependencies and build the UI into web/dist
	cd web && $(PNPM) install --frozen-lockfile && $(PNPM) run build

# The typed client (web/src/api/generated/schema.ts) is generated from the
# contract and committed, so a normal build does not need this. Re-run it after
# changing openapi.yaml; CI checks it stays in step (see the frontend job).
api-client: ## Regenerate the typed API client from openapi.yaml
	cd web && $(PNPM) run api:generate

# The Go binary embeds web/dist, so every Go build and test needs the directory
# to exist. Tests never serve it, so a placeholder is enough; `make frontend`
# still produces the real bundle. Without this, `go build ./...` fails on a
# checkout that has never run pnpm — which is most of them.

# --- Migrations (issue #14) ---
#
# The server applies the embedded migrations at startup (internal/database.Migrate),
# so these targets are for humans: authoring, validating offline, and inspecting
# or applying a pending set from a shell. `migrate-up` deliberately runs the
# binary, not the Goose CLI, so it also takes the advisory lock, seeds a legacy
# `schema_versions` ledger and writes the pre-migration backup — the Goose CLI
# does none of those.

migrate-create: ## Author a timestamped Goose migration: make migrate-create NAME=add_thing
	@if [ -z "$(NAME)" ]; then echo "usage: make migrate-create NAME=add_thing"; exit 1; fi
	$(GOOSE) -dir $(GOOSE_DIR) create "$(NAME)" sql

migrate-validate: ## Validate the Goose migration files offline (no database needed)
	$(GOOSE) -dir $(GOOSE_DIR) validate

# Reads the Goose ledger directly, so it does not seed a legacy ledger first;
# on an install upgrading from the old numbering, run `make migrate-up` once
# (it bootstraps) and status is accurate from then on.
# Needs DATABASE_URL and, because it goes through config.Load, TMDB_API_TOKEN.
migrate-status: ## Show migration status against $$DATABASE_URL
	@test -n "$$DATABASE_URL" || { echo 'DATABASE_URL is not set — run: make pg-up' >&2; exit 1; }
	$(GOOSE) -dir $(GOOSE_DIR) postgres "$$DATABASE_URL" status

migrate-up: ## Apply pending migrations (locks, bootstraps a legacy ledger, backs up)
	go run ./cmd/api --migrate-only

# --- Local PostgreSQL (development and DB-backed tests) ---
#
# Docker is not available everywhere, so these targets run a throwaway cluster
# with the host's own postgres binaries. See scripts/dev-pg.sh.

pg-up: ## Start a throwaway PostgreSQL and print its DATABASE_URL
	./scripts/dev-pg.sh start

pg-down: ## Stop the throwaway PostgreSQL
	./scripts/dev-pg.sh stop

pg-status: ## Show throwaway PostgreSQL status
	./scripts/dev-pg.sh status

# --- OpenAPI specification (issue #15) ---
#
# openapi.yaml is a generated artifact: it is produced from the code-first route
# registry by cmd/openapi, never edited by hand. `api-check` is the gate — it
# fails when the committed spec has drifted from the registry (freshness) or
# when the route inventory differs in either direction.

api-spec: embed-stub ## Regenerate openapi.yaml from the route registry
	go run ./cmd/openapi

api-check: embed-stub ## Verify openapi.yaml is fresh and its route inventory matches the registry
	go run ./cmd/openapi -check
	go test ./internal/httpapi/ -run TestOpenAPIRouteInventory -count=1
# --- Backups (issue #16) ---
#
# One-shot backup commands. They need DATABASE_URL and pg_dump/pg_restore on the
# host; the destination is $TKILLER_BACKUP_DIR (default ./backups). See
# docs/architecture/backups.md.

backup: embed-stub ## Take a manual database backup and exit (needs DATABASE_URL)
	TMDB_API_TOKEN=dummy go run ./cmd/api --backup

backup-list: embed-stub ## List database backups and exit (needs DATABASE_URL)
	TMDB_API_TOKEN=dummy go run ./cmd/api --backup-list

# --- Housekeeping ---

tidy: ## Tidy the Go module graph
	go mod tidy

clean: ## Remove build artifacts
	rm -rf bin

# --- Dev services (optional) ---

compose-up: ## Start the dev infrastructure (dev/compose.yml: postgres, redis, minio, mailpit)
	docker compose -f dev/compose.yml up -d

compose-down: ## Stop the dev infrastructure
	docker compose -f dev/compose.yml down

# --- Images (issue #13) ---
#
# CI builds both images (see .github/workflows/docker.yml); these targets are
# the same commands, for a local checkout. The omnibus build takes the omnibus/
# directory as its context, not the repo root.

docker-base: ## Build the base image (tkiller-api:base)
	docker build -t tkiller-api:base \
		--build-arg IMAGE_VERSION="$(shell git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
		--build-arg BUILD_REVISION="$(shell git rev-parse HEAD)" \
		--build-arg BUILD_DATE="$(shell date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" .

docker-omnibus: docker-base ## Build the omnibus image (tkiller-api:omnibus) from the base
	docker build -f omnibus/Dockerfile \
		--build-arg TKILLER_IMAGE=tkiller-api:base \
		-t tkiller-api:omnibus omnibus/

# The init and service scripts carry an s6 shebang (`#!/command/with-contenv
# bash`), so their interpreter has to be named. SC1091 is the "not following a
# sourced file" notice: lib.sh is a path that only exists inside the image.
docker-lint: ## Lint the omnibus shell scripts
	shellcheck -s bash -e SC1091 \
		omnibus/rootfs/etc/s6-overlay/scripts/* \
		omnibus/rootfs/etc/tkiller-omnibus/lib.sh \

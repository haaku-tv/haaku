# Social Handler (`internal/handlers/social`)

## What it does

Follow graph + approval flow. Eight routes:

- `POST /v1/users/:id/follow` — follow; private target → pending (`ApprovedAt` nil), else approved immediately. Idempotent (already-following returns 201 with current status).
- `DELETE /v1/users/:id/follow` — unfollow (204 / 404).
- `GET /v1/users/:id/followers|following|friends` — lists; friends = mutual approved follows (self-join on `user_follows`). **Public by design (ratified, issue #48).** The graph is served without a privacy gate even for a private `:id`: the follow counters are how the product shows community size, and the relationship is already visible through the public profile stub, so gating the list while the counters stay public would be inconsistent. No `settings.privacy.*` flag names the graph, so it stays ungated. See the cross-reference in `internal/handlers/users/users.md` ("Per-section privacy flags").
- `GET /v1/users/me/follow_requests` — pending incoming requests.
- `POST /v1/users/me/follow_requests/:follower_id/approve` — sets `approved_at`.
- `DELETE /v1/users/me/follow_requests/:follower_id` — deny (delete row).

Emits outbox events (`user.followed`, `user.unfollowed`, `user.follow_approved`). Reuses `database.UserFollow`/`User` models and `resolveUserStubs` for bulk profile resolution.

## Completion

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| OpenAPI registration (8 routes) | Done |
| Follow/unfollow (private→pending) | Done |
| Followers/following/friends lists | Done |
| Follow request list/approve/deny | Done |
| Outbox events on mutations | Done |

## Oversights

- **CRITICAL: no auth middleware on any route (RESOLVED)** — `RegisterRoutes` attached no `requireAuth`, and every handler read `c.Locals("user_id").(string)` with an **unchecked type assertion** (social.go:88, 151, 261, 303, 334), so an unauthenticated request hit `nil` → panic on the assert → 500 via Recovery, not 401. Now the 5 auth-required endpoints (follow, unfollow, follow_requests, approve, deny) run `auth.AuthRequired()` middleware, the 3 public read routes (followers/following/friends) stay unauthenticated per OpenAPI, and every handler uses the checked form returning 401 `unauthorized` when the user is missing.
- **No `cache.WithCacheTransaction`, no advisory locks (RESOLVED for cache-tx)** — mutations ran on plain `db` with outbox events published outside the write transaction. Now follow/unfollow/approve/deny run inside `cache.WithCacheTransaction`: DB commits first, then async cache invalidation; outbox events are published in-tx (roll back with the write). Both users' version counters (`BuildUserVersionKey`) are bumped on every mutation. Advisory locks on follow still pending (todo).
- **Raw event-name strings (RESOLVED)** — `"user.followed"`, `"user.unfollowed"`, `"user.follow_approved"` were literals AND wrong: the webhook catalog (`trakt-killer-plan/03-api/webhooks.md`) defines `follow.created` / `follow.approved` / `follow.removed`. Now `outbox.EventFollowCreated/Approved/Removed` are used, matching the catalog (payload includes `actor` + `target`).
- **No `notifications.CreateNotification`** — approval/follow events are outboxed but no notification record is created for the target (spec likely wants inbox notifications).
- **No pagination (RESOLVED)** — followers/following/friends/requests were unbounded lists (charter: unlimited data → must paginate). All four now paginate per §7 (`?page&limit`, default 25/max 100) with `X-Pagination-*` headers + `Link: rel="next"`.
- **No ordering (RESOLVED)** — lists were unordered. All four now order by `created_at DESC, id ASC` (id tiebreaker keeps pages stable).
- **Unchecked errors throughout (RESOLVED)** — the already-following existence check, the follow-request user fetch, and `resolveUserStubs` (used by friends/followers/following) now propagate DB failures as 500 `internal` instead of returning empty/partial lists.
- **`handleUnfollow` doesn't guard self-follow** (`targetID == followerID`) while `handleFollow` does.
- **`handleFollow` returns 201 for already-following** — arguably should be 200 or an idempotent 201; at least it diverges from REST semantics.
- **Local error helpers** (`writeError`/`badRequest`/`notFound`) duplicated from `internal/httpapi` (the hand-rolled timestamp literals were unified to `response.FormatTime` in Batch 3).
- **No rate limiting / abuse control** on follow spam (429 per charter).

## Todos

- [x] Attach `auth.AuthRequired` to all mutation routes; drop unchecked asserts (fail closed with 401). Public reads (followers/following/friends) stay open — **ratified as public by design (issue #48), see "What it does".**
- [x] Wrap follow/unfollow/approve/deny in `cache.WithCacheTransaction` with version-counter invalidation and in-tx outbox publish.
- [x] Define typed outbox constants for follow events — `EventFollowCreated/Approved/Removed` matching the webhook catalog (`follow.created` / `follow.approved` / `follow.removed`); old `user.*` names were drift. Advisory locks on follow still pending.
- [x] Create inbox notifications on follow/approve. (Batch 7 — in-tx via `notifications.CreateNotification`)
- [x] Add pagination + stable ordering to all list endpoints.
- [x] Handle all DB errors instead of ignoring them. (Batch 6)
- [x] Use shared `internal/response` helpers (leaf envelope package now exists, unblocking this).
- [x] Verify module test coverage (`make test`). (Batch 14 — `internal/handlers/social/social_test.go` covers `totalPages` and `buildFollowResponse` (approved vs pending). Handler-level integration for the DB-backed follow/unfollow/list paths awaits a DB-driver approval.)

# Lists Handler (`internal/handlers/lists`)

## What it does

Implements lists, list items, likes, comments, popular/trending, and smart lists (21 OpenAPI routes). This is the largest handler module and the one that most consistently applies the cache/outbox conventions.

**Response shape**

Every route that serves a list serves the **contract's list object**
(`contractshape.ListWithItemCount`): `ids.trakt` (the list row id), `ids.slug`,
`item_count` (counted, not fabreed), `likes`, `comment_count`, `user`. The native
handlers used to answer the stored `database.List` row, which carries no `ids` at
all — the web client is typed on the contract object, so `list.ids.trakt` threw
and the My Lists page died, while `/users/me/lists/collaborations` (which already
used the contract builder) rendered fine. Owners and item counts are fetched in
one batched query each (`contractListObjects`), never per row.

List **items** are served in the contract's item shape
(`contractListItemObjects`): `{rank, id, listed_at, type, movie|show|season|episode}`,
where `id` is the **join-row** id — the value remove/reorder accept — and the
media id lives inside the nested object only.

**List CRUD**
- `GET /users/{id}/lists` — user's lists, privacy-filtered (public+link_only for non-owners) and
  profile-gated: `auth.AuthRequired()` then `auth.PrivacyFilter("id")`, so a private profile's
  lists are 403 to a stranger (404 on a block in either direction / unknown user). `{id}` accepts
  the `me` alias (`auth.ResolveTargetID`): `/users/me/lists` is the caller's own lists *including
  their private ones*, which is what the owner branch means — read raw, "me" was treated as a
  stranger's id and only the public ones came back.
- `POST /users/me/lists` — create (slug generated from name + user-id prefix, collision → timestamp suffix).
- `GET /lists/{id}` — by numeric ID **or slug**; 403 for private lists.
- `PUT /lists/{id}` / `DELETE /lists/{id}` — owner-only; advisory-locked cache-tx writes.

**List items**
- `GET /users/me/lists/containing` — **reverse index for a media page**: the caller's own lists
  that hold one `?type=&media_id=` item, as contract list objects (`[]` when none, 400 on a bad
  type or a non-positive id). Owner-only lists on purpose: item writes are owner-only, so a list
  the caller merely collaborates on could not be toggled from where this read is used.
- `GET /lists/{id}/items` — paginated; sorted per list `sort_by`/`sort_how`; `type` filter;
  contract item objects (see *Response shape*).
- `POST /lists/{id}/items` — add movies/shows/seasons/episodes by `ids.trakt` (our own row id,
  what the API serves and what clients echo back), then `ids.tmdb`→`ExternalID`, then `ids.imdb`
  (`resolveContractMedia`, shared with the contract path); reports `added`/`not_found`/`duplicate`.
  Reading only `ids.tmdb` is why "Add" from a media page answered 201 and added nothing.
- `POST /lists/{id}/items/remove` — remove by item ID or by the same media reference.
- `PUT /lists/{id}/items/reorder` — assigns rank by array position; marks list ranked.

**Likes / comments / discovery**
- `GET/POST/DELETE /lists/{id}/like` — like_count incremented via `UpdateColumn`; likes list.
- `GET /lists/{id}/comments` — list comments.
- `GET /lists/popular` (period weekly/monthly/all) and `/lists/trending` (like-weight × recency score).

**Smart lists (T4.2)**
- Full CRUD at `/users/me/smart-lists` and `/smart-lists/{id}`; ownership enforced.
- `GET /smart-lists/{id}/items` — resolves the filter DSL (`genres`, `year`, `rating_min`, `votes_min`, `status`, `watched`, `collected`, `type`) against movies/shows tables with user-history subqueries and allowlisted sort columns.

Writes go through `cache.WithCacheTransaction` with list/user version-key bumps and outbox events (`list.created/updated/deleted/items.added/items.removed`).

## Oversights

- **`requireAuth` hand-rolled (RESOLVED)** — routes now run shared `auth.AuthRequired()` (Batch 1); the redundant per-handler `uid == ""` checks were dropped.
- **Local error helpers (RESOLVED)** — full local set (`authRequired`/`badRequest`/`notFound`/`forbidden`/`internalError`) replaced by `internal/response` (Batch 0).
- **SQL-injection exposure in sort ordering (RESOLVED)** — `handleGetListItems` did `fmt.Sprintf("%s %s", sortCol, sortDir)` (lists.go:609) with `sortCol` coming straight from the stored `List.SortBy` (no allowlist, unlike smart lists); an owner could store an arbitrary `sort_by` that becomes raw SQL on every items read. New `resolveListItemSort(sortBy, sortHow)` maps sort keys through an allowlist (`rank`, `added_at`, `media_type`, `media_id`, `notes`), falls back to `rank` for unknown keys, and normalizes direction to ASC/DESC (lists.go:598-625). Unit-tested in `internal/handlers/lists/lists_test.go`.
- **Trending score SQL injection** — `handleGetTrendingLists` embeds a fixed expression (safe) but note it's a hardcoded PG expression; acceptable.
- **`generateSlug` userID slicing** — `userID[0:8]` panics if user id is shorter than 8 chars (e.g. empty or short test ids). No length guard.
- **Smart-list pagination is per-type, not global** — each media type queries with its own `OFFSET/LIMIT`, then results are concatenated; global pagination is wrong (offset applies per table, `total_count` is summed). Page 2 may repeat/drop items.
- **Smart-list `total_count` sums across types** while items come from each type's page slice — envelope can report totals that don't match the returned page.
- **`applyFilterDSL` genre filter** — `genres::jsonb ? ?` uses `&&`-style membership per genre but the JSONB operator `?` inside `jsonb` column assumes a JSONB array; confirm column type matches the DSL.
- **`handleAddListItems` closure writes to `result` inside the transaction** — shared mutable state mutated by `processMediaItems` closure; fine since single-threaded, but the `result` is populated even if the tx later fails/rolls back (client sees counts for a rolled-back op → tx returns nil error only on success, so OK, but the non-tx `result.NotFound` appends from a failed resolve are still reported on rollback).
- **`handleLikeList` uses `res.RowsAffected` with `OnConflict{DoNothing}`** — depends on a unique constraint on (list_id, user_id); if the constraint is missing, duplicate likes inflate `like_count`.
- **Comments endpoint not paginated** — `GET /lists/{id}/comments` returns all comments unbounded.
- **Item responses expose raw `database.List`** in several places** (e.g. `resp["list"] = list`, popular/trending return `database.List` directly) — DB models leak to the API without response mapping; inconsistent with list-item mapping elsewhere.

## Todos

- [x] Fix SQL injection in `handleGetListItems` ordering — `resolveListItemSort` allowlist + unit test (lists_test.go).
- [x] Guard `userID[0:8]` in `generateSlug` against short/empty ids (length-safe suffix + tests).
- [x] Fix smart-list pagination to page over the combined result set, not per-type. (Batch 8 — per-type queries now fetch the full ordered match set with no OFFSET/LIMIT; the page is sliced from the combined result in Go, so `row_count` (full combined total) matches and pages no longer repeat/drop items.)
- [x] Paginate `GET /lists/{id}/comments`. (Batch 8 — `?page&limit` default 25/max 100 with §7 `X-Pagination-*` headers + `Link: rel="next"`; stable `created_at ASC, id ASC` order.)
- [x] Ensure unique constraint exists for list likes; consider a DB-level check. (Batch 12 — VERIFIED: no DB change needed.) `list_likes` (migration 0019) declares `PRIMARY KEY (list_id, user_id)`, and the GORM `ListLike` model mirrors it with composite primary keys on `(ListID, UserID)`. So a duplicate like is rejected at the DB level regardless of the handler's `OnConflict{DoNothing}` — the PK guarantees a user cannot like the same list twice, so `like_count` can never be inflated by a missing constraint. Confirmed; no schema change required.)
- [x] Replace local error helpers with `internal/response` (Batch 0).
- [x] Replace local `authRequired`/`requireAuth` with `auth.AuthRequired` (Batch 1).
- [x] Response mapping for `database.List` leaks: every list route now serves the contract
  object (popular/trending included), and items serve the contract item object. The item read
  no longer offers `extended` — the list object is one `GET /lists/{id}` away, and the item
  payload is the same shape either way.
- [x] Verify the `genres::jsonb ? ?` filter matches the column type. (Batch 12 — VERIFIED: yes.) The smart-list `genres` filter runs against the movies/shows tables, whose `genres` columns are `JSONB DEFAULT '[]'` (migration 0002; GORM `StringSlice` with `type:jsonb`). The PostgreSQL `?` operator on a jsonb **array** tests whether the given text is an element of the array — exactly the containment semantics the DSL wants ("media has this genre"), and matches how ingest stores genres (a JSON array of genre names, e.g. `["Science Fiction","Drama"]`). The explicit `::jsonb` cast is redundant-but-harmless (the column is already jsonb). Confirmed correct against the column type; no change needed. Note: values compared are the stored genre *names*, not the `/genres` slugs — see `reference.md` Batch 12 slug-strategy note.)
- [ ] Verify module test coverage (`make test`).

// Package paritystub registers a 501 stub for every Trakt endpoint haaku does not
// serve yet, so the surface is complete and honest: a client asking for an
// unimplemented endpoint gets `501 not_implemented` naming the blocker and the issue
// that tracks it, rather than a 404 that reads as "this endpoint does not exist".
//
// Nothing here serves data. A stub disappears as its owning issue lands: the real
// handler is registered by the owning package and the manifest row moves out of
// blocked-* in the same PR. See docs/parity/parity.yaml and issue #4.

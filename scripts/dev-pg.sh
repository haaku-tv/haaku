# Boot a throwaway PostgreSQL for development and DB-backed tests.
#
# Docker is not available in every environment (CI runners, agent sandboxes,
# contributor laptops without a daemon), so this uses the host's own server
# binaries when they are installed. It creates a cluster in a temporary
# directory, listens on a unix socket only (no TCP port, so nothing is exposed
# to the network), and prints the DATABASE_URL to export.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/dev-pg.sh start     # create + start, print the URL
#   ./scripts/dev-pg.sh stop      # stop the server (data is kept)
#   ./scripts/dev-pg.sh destroy   # stop and delete the data directory
#   ./scripts/dev-pg.sh status    # report whether it is running
#   eval "$(./scripts/dev-pg.sh start -q)"   # export DATABASE_URL in one line
#
# Environment:
#   TKILLER_PG_DIR   data directory        (default: /tmp/tkiller-dev-pg-<checkout id>)
#   TKILLER_PG_SOCK  socket directory      (default: /tmp/tkiller-dev-pg-sock-<checkout id>)
#   TKILLER_PG_DB    database name         (default: trakt)
#   TKILLER_PG_USER  role name             (default: trakt)
#   TKILLER_PG_BIN   directory of the postgres binaries (autodetected)
#
# The data directory defaults to a per-checkout path, so two clones or worktrees
# of this repository never share a cluster. Run `./scripts/dev-pg.sh paths` to
# see which ones this checkout uses.

set -euo pipefail

# Default to a cluster PER CHECKOUT.
#
# Two working copies of this repository (a second clone, a git worktree, or two
# agents in one sandbox) must never share a data directory: they would share one
# cluster and one database, and one of them applying a migration, dropping a
# table or seeding rows silently breaks the other's run. The suffix is derived
# from the working copy's path, so the same checkout always reuses its own
# cluster and different checkouts never collide.
#
# Override TKILLER_PG_DIR / TKILLER_PG_SOCK to share one deliberately.

# Size ratchet (issue #8).
#
# tools/size-baseline.txt lists every tracked Go file that is already over the
# soft limit. Those files may only shrink; any other file must stay under the
# limit. The point is not to ban big files — it is to stop the existing ones
# growing while a subsystem is being split up.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-size.sh             # gate (what CI runs)
#   scripts/check-size.sh --update    # rewrite the baseline from the current tree
#
# Env:
#   SOFT_LIMIT  line count above which a file must be tracked (default 800)
